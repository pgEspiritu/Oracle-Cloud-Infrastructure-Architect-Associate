# 🎯 Optimizing IAM Policies in OCI

## 🔑 Why Optimize IAM Policies?

Think of IAM policies as a **lock-and-key system**. Too many "keys" (policies) for the same "lock" (resource) can cause:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Management complexity
- API performance issues
- Hitting OCI policy and statement limits

✅ Optimizing policies helps:

- Stay within limits
- Simplify audits
- Improve security
- Enhance performance

## 🧹 Remove Exact Duplicates

### 🔁 Problem

Multiple **identical policy statements** attached to the same compartment.

👥 Often caused by different teams creating redundant policies without coordination.

### ✅ Solution

- **Delete exact duplicates**
- Assign **clear ownership** of policy management
- Implement a **review process** for policy changes

---

## 🪜 Inheritance Redundancy

### 📘 Scenario

- Compartment A:  
  `Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family`

- Compartment B (child of A):  
  `Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family`

### ❌ Problem

OCI IAM uses **policy inheritance** — permissions in a parent compartment apply to its children.

### ✅ Solution

- Remove redundant policy from **Compartment B**
- Always check **permission scope** before creating a new policy

## 🔓 IAM Verbs Refresher

| Verb      | Permissions                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `inspect` | View basic info                            |
| `read`    | View detailed info                         |
| `use`     | Perform specific actions                   |
| `manage`  | Full control (includes all above)          |

> `manage` ⊇ `use` ⊇ `read` ⊇ `inspect`

## ⚠️ Misleading Restrictive Policies

### 📘 Scenario

- Compartment A:  
  `Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family`

- Compartment B:  
  `Allow group NetworkAdmins to use virtual-network-family`

Even though the second policy looks more restrictive, it's redundant due to **inheritance**.

### ✅ Solution

- Remove the **lesser-scope** policy
- Avoid writing **restrictive conditions** in child compartments if broad permissions are granted above

---

## ❗ Why Conditions Can Be Ignored

Even if you define specific conditions like MFA checks or narrow permissions in a child compartment, OCI IAM **will ignore restrictions** if:

- A **broader permission** is granted higher in the hierarchy

> OCI IAM always **grants the maximum effective permission** from all in-scope policies.

---

## 🧠 Group Membership-Based Optimization

### 📘 Scenario

- Two child compartments: B and C
- Similar policies for `NetworkAdminB` and `NetworkAdminC` groups

### Option 1: Groups Have Same Members

✅ **Combine into one policy** attached to the **parent** compartment:

```text
Allow group NetworkAdminB, NetworkAdminC to manage virtual-network-family in compartment A
  where any { target.compartment.name = 'B', target.compartment.name = 'C' }
```

### Option 2: Groups Have Different Members
✅ Use `any` and `all` conditions to restrict access:
```text
Allow group NetworkAdminB, NetworkAdminC to manage virtual-network-family in compartment A
  where any {
    all {
      target.compartment.name = 'B',
      request.group.id = '<OCID_of_NetworkAdminB>'
    },
    all {
      target.compartment.name = 'C',
      request.group.id = '<OCID_of_NetworkAdminC>'
    }
  }
```
> 🔐 This ensures that each group can only access its own compartment, even though the policy is defined at a higher level.
