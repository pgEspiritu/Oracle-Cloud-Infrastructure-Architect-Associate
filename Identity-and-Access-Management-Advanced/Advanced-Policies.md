# Advanced Policies in OCI: Enforcing Least Privilege


## üîê What Are Permissions?

Permissions are **atomic units of authorization** that control a user's ability to perform operations on resources. These permissions are managed using **verbs** like:

- `manage`
- `inspect`
- `use`
- `read`

These verbs simplify the process of granting multiple related permissions by grouping them into a broader access level.

---

## üîß How Policies Work

Policies are built using **two main elements**:

- A **verb** (e.g., `manage`)
- A **resource-type** (e.g., `volume`)

OCI then **automatically grants predefined permissions** in the background. You don‚Äôt need to manually assign each permission.

---

## üìò Example: Volume Resource

Here‚Äôs what happens behind the scenes for the `volume` resource:

| Verb     | Permissions Added                   | API Access Included             |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| inspect  | `VOLUME_INSPECT`                   | `ListVolume`, `GetVolume`       |
| read     | `VOLUME_INSPECT` + others          | ‚Äî                                |
| use      | `INSPECT`, `UPDATE`, `WRITE`       | ‚Äî                                |
| manage   | All permissions incl. `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `MOVE` | Full control           |

> üîç **Note**: Permissions are always in **UPPERCASE** like `VOLUME_INSPECT`, `VOLUME_UPDATE`.

## üéØ Enforcing Least Privilege with Advanced Policies

Let‚Äôs rewrite policies using advanced techniques.

### ‚ùå Policy A (Too Broad)
```text
Allow group audit-group to manage objects in compartment Acme
```
- Uses `manage` ‚Üí grants all permissions
- ‚ùó Violates least privilege

### ‚úÖ Rewrite: Restrict to Specific Bucket & Permission
```text
Allow group audit-group to manage object-family in compartment Acme 
where target.bucket.name='myBucket' and request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE'
```
- Restricts to:
  - Specific bucket
  - Specific permission (`OBJECT_CREATE` only)
 
---

### ‚úÖ Example: Deny Delete Permission
Objective: Allow Group XYZ to list, create, update, write, and move block volumes ‚Äî but not delete.
Method 1: Explicitly Define Allowed Permissions
```text
Allow group XYZ to manage volume-family in compartment Acme 
where all {request.permission='VOLUME_CREATE', request.permission='VOLUME_UPDATE', request.permission='VOLUME_MOVE'}
```

Method 2: Exclude a Permission
```text
Allow group XYZ to manage volume-family in compartment Acme 
where request.permission != 'VOLUME_DELETE'
```

Method 3: Use API Operation
```text
Allow group XYZ to manage volume-family in compartment Acme 
where request.operation in ('CreateVolume', 'UpdateVolume', 'MoveVolume')
```

---

### üóÇ Example: Upload/Inspect in Buckets Only
Objective: Group should only upload or inspect objects in any bucket.
```text
Allow group auditors to manage object-family in compartment Acme 
where any {request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE', request.permission='OBJECT_INSPECT'}
```

Further restrict to a specific bucket:
```text
... where target.bucket.name = 'my-audit-bucket'
```

---

### üïí Time-Based Policy Example
Objective: Allow contractors to use instances only at specific times.
```text
Allow group contractor to use instance-family in compartment Acme 
where request.time < '2025-12-31T23:59:59Z'
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- Use verbs to simplify access control.
- Use permissions and conditions to go granular.
- Combine target.resource.name, request.permission, request.operation, and request.time for full control.
- Avoid broad manage access unless absolutely required.

---

## üí° Admin Tip
Structure policies wisely to maintain clear and secure access control. Applying the least privilege principle helps protect your OCI resources while giving users exactly the access they need‚Äîno more, no less.
