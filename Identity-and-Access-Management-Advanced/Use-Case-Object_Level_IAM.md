# 🎓 Granular Access Control for OCI Object Storage

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will understand how object-level IAM policies can enhance the security of your objects.

## 📦 Object Storage Basics

OCI Object Storage is:

- **Scalable** and **high-performance**
- Designed for large volumes of data
- **Durable** with multiple copies and data integrity checks
- Accessible and reliable

### 🪣 Buckets and Objects

- **Bucket**: A container for unstructured data (e.g., files, images, videos)
- **Object**: Each file within a bucket

In this lesson, we focus on **object-level access control**.

---

## 🛡️ IAM Policies for Object Storage

When accessing object storage, policies can be defined:

- At the **bucket level**
- At the **object level**
- As **single-object family policies**
- Scoped at **tenancy** or **compartment** level

You can **add conditions** to target specific buckets or objects.  
Example: Allow only object **creation and inspection** for `BucketA`.

## 🔄 Managing Complex Access Scenarios

Consider a shared bucket with:

- Dataset 1: Active project data
- Dataset 2: Archived data
- Dataset 3: Another active dataset

Different users or groups may require different access levels:

- **Group 1** → read/write for `Dataset 1`
- **Group 2** → read/copy for `Dataset 1`
- Individual users → access to specific objects

✅ **Solution**: Use **object-level permissions** via `target.object.name`.

---

## 🧩 Object-Level Access with `target.object.name`

IAM access can be scoped:

- **Tenancy level**
- **Compartment level**
- **Bucket level**
- **Object level** with `target.object.name`

This provides:

- Fine-grained control over specific **files/folders**
- Ability to restrict actions: read, write, delete, copy
- Support for large-scale workloads (millions of objects)

## 🧪 Examples of Object IAM Policies

### Example 1: Full Access to Prod Folder
```plaintext
Allow group <GroupName> to manage objects in Tenancy where
  all {target.bucket.name='test-bucket', target.object.name='/prod/*'}
```

### Example 2: Read-Only Access
```plaintext
Allow group <GroupName> to manage objects in Tenancy where
  all {target.bucket.name='test-bucket', target.object.name='/prod/*',
    any {request.permission="OBJECT_INSPECT', request.permission'OBJECT_READ'}}
```

### Example 3: Write-Once Access in Development Folder
```plaintext
Allow group <GroupName> to manage objects in Tenancy where
  all {target.bucket.name='test-bucket', target.object.name='/prod/*',
    any {request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE'}}
```

### Example 4: Full Access to PDF Files for a Specific User
```plaintext
Allow group <GroupName> to manage objects in Tenancy where
  all {target.bucket.name='test-bucket', target.object.name='/dev/*',
    any {request.permission='OBJECT_CREATE', request_permission='OBJECT_READ'}}
```

## ✅ Summary
In this lesson, we learned how to:
- Define fine-grained access control at the object level
- Manage folder-specific access
- Apply targeted permissions (e.g., file type restrictions)
- Enhance security while maintaining flexibility
