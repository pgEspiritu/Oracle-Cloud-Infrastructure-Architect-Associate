# Identity and Access Management â€“ Advanced  

This section explores **advanced IAM concepts in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**. It builds on the fundamentals by introducing policy inheritance, conditional access, tag-based controls, dynamic groups, and optimization techniques to fine-tune security and access management.
