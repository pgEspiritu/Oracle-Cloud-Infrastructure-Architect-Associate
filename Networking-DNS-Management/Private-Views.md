# Private Views in OCI

## What is a Private View?
- A **Private View** is a **collection of Private DNS Zones**.  
- Private Views allow you to logically group zones together.  

---

## Key Rules
- A **zone** (e.g., `samvit.com`) can belong to **only one view**.  
  - If `samvit.com` belongs to `ViewA`, it **cannot** belong to `ViewB`.  

---

## Relationship with VCN and Resolver
- Every **VCN** has a **DNS Resolver**.  
- Each resolver comes with a **default private view**.  
- You can:
  - Add zones to the default view.  
  - Create **custom views** and attach them to the resolver.  

---

## Sharing Across VCNs
- One **view** can be used by multiple resolvers.  
- But each **zone** can only exist in one view.  
- Purpose of attaching a custom view to a resolver:
  - Makes the zones inside that view **resolvable within the VCN**.  
  - Enables **sharing private DNS data across VCNs**.  

---

## Summary
- **Private View = Collection of Private DNS Zones**.  
- **Zones → One View only**.  
- **Resolvers → Default view + optional custom views**.  
- **Views → Can be reused across multiple resolvers**.  
- Main benefit: **enables hostname resolution and DNS data sharing across VCNs**.
