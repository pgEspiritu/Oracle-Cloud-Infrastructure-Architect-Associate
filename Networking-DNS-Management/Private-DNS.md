# Private DNS Zone in OCI

## DNS Options in a VCN
Instances in a **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** have three choices for DNS name resolution:

1. **Internet and VCN Resolver (default)**  
   - Internet resolver → resolves publicly published hostnames.  
   - VCN resolver → resolves hostnames of other instances in the same VCN.  

2. **Custom Resolver**  
   - Can use any DNS server (internet-based, inside the VCN, or on-prem).  

3. **Private DNS (OCI Service)**  
   - Provides hostname resolution **within a VCN**, **across VCNs**, and **between VCNs and on-premises networks**.  
   - Eliminates need for custom solutions for cross-VCN resolution.

## Resources in Private DNS
### 1. **Private DNS Zone**
- Contains DNS data.
- Supports record types: `A`, `AAAA`, `PTR`, etc.

### 2. **Private DNS View**
- A **collection of zones**.  
- Each zone belongs to **one view**.  

### 3. **Private DNS Resolver**
- Contains the configuration that serves DNS query responses within the VCN.  
- Structure:
  - **Resolver** → has **Views**  
  - **Views** → contain **Zones**  
  - **Zones** → hold **Records**

### 4. **Private DNS Records**
- Supported record types:  
  - `A` → Hostname to IPv4 mapping  
  - `AAAA` → Hostname to IPv6 mapping  
  - `PTR` → Reverse mapping  

### 5. **Private DNS Resolver Endpoints**
- Provide ingress and egress for DNS within the VCN.  
- Each endpoint consumes a **private IP address**.  

Types:  
- **Listener Endpoint** → Responds to queries from outside the VCN/OCI.  
- **Forwarder Endpoint** → Redirects queries to external DNS servers (custom or on-prem).

## Benefits of Private DNS
- Hostname resolution:
  - Within a VCN  
  - Across VCNs  
  - Between VCNs and on-premises/private networks  
- Provides more **granular control** and avoids manual/custom DNS deployments.
