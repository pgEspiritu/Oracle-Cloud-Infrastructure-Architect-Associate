# OS Management Hub Service 🖥️🔧

## Why Do We Need It? 🤔

### Common Challenges for Administrators
- **Patching Complexity** ⚡  
  - Different vendors release updates on different cycles.  
  - Example: Oracle releases quarterly CPU patches, while Linux security patches are unpredictable.  
- **Compliance & Reporting** 📑  
  - Ensuring SLAs, generating audit reports, and meeting regulations.  
- **Monitoring & Assessment** 📊  
  - Identifying performance issues quickly and resolving them.  

### Scaling Problem 🚀
- Managing a handful of instances manually is manageable.  
- But with **hundreds of instances**:
  - Patching becomes **time-consuming and error-prone**.  
  - Increases **security risks** if even one patch is missed.  
  - Expands complexity across **on-premises + multiple clouds**.
