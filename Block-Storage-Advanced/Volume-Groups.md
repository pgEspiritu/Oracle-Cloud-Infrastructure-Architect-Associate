# 📘 Lesson: Volume Groups in OCI

## 🎬 Introduction
OCI Block Volume service allows you to group together multiple volumes into a **Volume Group**.  
This helps in managing backups and clones that are **point-in-time** and **crash consistent**.

---

## 🔹 Key Features of Volume Groups
- Can include:
  - **Boot Volumes** → system disks for compute instances  
  - **Block Volumes** → data storage  
- Supports up to:
  - **32 volumes per group**  
  - **128 TB total combined size**  
- Volumes can **vary in size**, but the group’s **total size ≤ 128 TB**.  
- Each volume can belong to **only one group**.  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Deleting a **Volume Group** does **not delete the individual volumes**.  
- To delete a **volume inside a group**, you must **remove it from the group first**.  

---

## 💡 Use Case: Enterprise Application
Imagine an enterprise application with **multiple tiers**:
- Web tier  
- Application tier  
- Database tier  

Each tier has associated block volumes.  
📍 Volume Groups allow you to create **time-consistent backups** across all these volumes at once.

---

## 🛠️ Backup & Restore
- **Scheduled Volume Group Backups** → configured with a **backup policy**.  
- Backups are **point-in-time** and **crash consistent**.  
- You can restore an **entire group of volumes** from a volume group backup.  

---

## 💲 Cost
- Volume Groups are available at **no additional charge**.  

---

## ✅ Summary
- Volume Groups simplify **management of multiple related volumes**.  
- Provide **consistent backups** for complex multi-tier applications.  
- Support **automation via backup policies**.  
- Easy to restore an **entire environment**.
