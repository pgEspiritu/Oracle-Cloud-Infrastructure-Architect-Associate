# 🗄️ Overview of Object Storage

## 📦 OCI Storage Services
OCI provides multiple storage services.  
In this lesson, we’ll focus on **Object Storage** and **Archive Storage**.

- 🌐 **Unlimited capacity** with **high durability**  
- 📏 Store objects up to **10 TiB** (1 TiB ≈ 1.1 TB)  
- 🖼️ Best suited for **unstructured data** (images, videos, logs, backups)  
- 🗄️ Use **Archive Storage** for **long-term archival** needs
