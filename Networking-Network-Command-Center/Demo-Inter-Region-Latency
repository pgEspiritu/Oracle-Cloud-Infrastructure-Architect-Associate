# 🌐 Inter-Region Latency Demonstration

## 🖥️ Accessing the Dashboard
1. Log in to the **OCI Console**.  
2. Navigate via **☰ Menu → Networking → Network Command Center**.  
3. Under **Visualizations & Dashboards**, select **Inter-Region Latency**.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
The **Inter-Region Latency Dashboard** provides two main charts:

1. **⏱️ Current Inter-Region Round-Trip Time (ms)**  
   - Displays the **average round-trip latency** between two regions.  
   - Calculated as an average of values over the **last 5 minutes**.  
   - New measurements are captured **every minute**.  

2. **📉 Inter-Region Round-Trip Time (30 Days, ms)**  
   - Provides a **historical view** of latency data over the past 30 days.  
   - Useful for validating long-term performance.

## 🔍 Demonstration Steps

### 1. Current Latency
- Example: **Phoenix → Mumbai**  
- Select regions and click **Show**.  
- Result: Current latency ≈ **247.82 ms** (average of the last 5 minutes).  

### 2. Historical Latency
- Example: **Phoenix → Mumbai**  
- Select the same regions in the **30-Day Latency Chart**.  
- Result: Displays the **historical round-trip latency trend** for the past month.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- The dashboard helps visualize both **real-time** and **historical** latency.  
- Measurements are based on the **OCI backbone network**, not individual tenancy workloads.  
- Supports planning and troubleshooting by comparing latency across regions.
