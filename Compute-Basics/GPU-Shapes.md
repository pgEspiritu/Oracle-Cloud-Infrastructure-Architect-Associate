# üéÆ OCI Compute ‚Äì GPU Shapes

## üìå Introduction
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides **GPU shapes** designed for **hardware-accelerated workloads**.  

**Hardware acceleration** = process where applications offload specific tasks to specialized hardware (GPUs) to **increase performance**.  

---

## ‚ö° Key Features
- Powered by **NVIDIA GPUs**: A100, A10, V100, P100  
- Available as **Bare Metal** and **Virtual Machine (VM) instances**  
- **Ultra-low latency cluster networking** with **RDMA** (Remote Direct Memory Access)  
  - Delivers **microsecond-level latency**  
  - Scale up to **500+ GPUs in a cluster**
