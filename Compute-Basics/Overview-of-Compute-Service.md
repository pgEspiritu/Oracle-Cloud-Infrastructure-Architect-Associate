# ☁️ OCI Compute Service – Overview

## 🖥️ What is OCI Compute Service?
- Lets you **provision and manage compute hosts (instances)**.  
- Serves as the **foundation for other OCI services**.  
- Provides flexibility with a variety of **shapes** to meet application requirements.  

---

## 🔹 Shapes
A **shape** is a template that defines the resources allocated to an instance, such as:
- Number of **OCPUs**  
- Amount of **Memory**  
- Additional hardware resources  

---

## 🏗️ Instance Types
OCI Compute offers two types of instances:

1. **Bare Metal Instances**
   - Provides dedicated access to the physical server.  
   - Best for high-performance workloads requiring full control.  

2. **Virtual Machine (VM) Instances**
   - Independent computing environments running on top of bare metal hardware.  
   - Flexible and scalable for general workloads.  

---

## 💾 Storage Behavior
- **Local drives** → Data is **lost upon termination** of the instance.  
- **Attached block volumes** → Data is **retained**, even if the instance is terminated.  

---

## ✅ Summary
- OCI Compute enables you to deploy **bare metal or VM instances**.  
- **Shapes** define CPU, memory, and resource allocations.  
- Use block volumes to ensure data persistence.
