# üñ•Ô∏è OCI Compute ‚Äì Bare Metal, Virtual Machines, and Dedicated Hosts

## üìå Introduction
OCI provides multiple deployment models for compute workloads: **Bare Metal Instances**, **Virtual Machine (VM) Instances**, and **Dedicated Hosts**.  
Each option is designed for different performance, isolation, and compliance needs.

---

## ‚ö° Bare Metal Instances
- Direct access to **underlying physical hardware**.  
- **Dedicated physical server** = highest performance + strong isolation.  
- **Best suited for:**
  - Non-virtualized workloads  
  - Performance-intensive workloads  
  - Bring Your Own License (BYOL) scenarios  
  - Workloads requiring a **specific hypervisor**

---

## ‚ö° Virtual Machine Instances
- Run **on top of bare metal hardware**.  
- **Hypervisor** virtualizes the physical server into multiple VMs.  
- **Best suited for:**
  - Applications that **don‚Äôt require full physical machine performance**  
  - General-purpose applications and workloads  
  - Cost-effective deployments

---

## ‚ö° Dedicated Hosts
- Combines **bare metal performance** with **VM flexibility**.  
- Multiple VMs run on a **bare metal server dedicated to a single customer**.  
- **Benefits:**
  - Meets compliance and regulatory isolation requirements  
  - Prevents use of shared infrastructure  
  - Ideal for organizations with **strict security and isolation mandates**

## üìù Quick Comparison

| Feature                | Bare Metal           | Virtual Machine (VM) | Dedicated Host                  |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Access**             | Full physical server | Virtualized instance | Full server dedicated to one tenant |
| **Performance**        | Highest              | Shared, lower than bare metal | High (bare metal performance) |
| **Isolation**          | Strong               | Shared               | Strong (dedicated to customer) |
| **Use Cases**          | HPC, BYOL, custom hypervisors | General workloads, apps | Compliance-driven workloads |
| **Flexibility**        | Limited              | High                 | Moderate (VMs on dedicated HW) |

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **Bare Metal** ‚Üí best for raw performance, non-virtualized, and custom workloads.  
- **VMs** ‚Üí cost-efficient, flexible, good for most applications.  
- **Dedicated Hosts** ‚Üí a middle ground, offering VM flexibility with dedicated physical isolation.
