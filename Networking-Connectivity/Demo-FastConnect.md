## üîπ Option 1: FastConnect Partner

1. **Select a Partner**
   - In the Console, choose **FastConnect Partner**.
   - Based on your region, you‚Äôll see a list of available partners (e.g., **Equinix**).
   - Select the partner of your choice.

   - **Compartment**: Choose the compartment for the resource.  
   - **Virtual Circuit Type**:
     - **Private** (requires a Dynamic Routing Gateway).  
     - **Public** (for accessing OCI public services).  

3. **Traffic Options**
   - Choose whether you want:  
     - **All traffic**, or  
     - **Only IPSec over FastConnect traffic** (encryption option).

4. **Routing and Bandwidth**
   - Select the **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)** (if using private peering).  
   - Configure **provisioned bandwidth** (1 Gbps to 10 Gbps).  

5. **BGP Configuration**
   - Enter your **BGP Peering IP Address** (from /28 to /31 range).  
   - (Optional) Provide **Oracle BGP IPv4 address**.  
   - Provide your **ASN** (Autonomous System Number), either public or private.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The partner handles the physical connectivity, so you do not deal with cabling or LOA in this case.

   - You must hand over the LOA to the **data center provider** or **third-party carrier**.  

5. **Cabling and Activation**

   - Once done, you can **activate the cross-connect** in OCI Console.

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Partner Model**:
  - Easy to set up.  
  - Select partner ‚Üí Provide connection + BGP details ‚Üí Partner provisions connectivity.  
  - **No LOA needed**.

- **Direct Model** (Third-Party Provider / Co-Location):
  - Create cross-connect ‚Üí Receive **LOA** ‚Üí Hand it to data center/carrier ‚Üí Cabling ‚Üí Activate.  
  - Provides more control and flexibility but requires manual coordination.
