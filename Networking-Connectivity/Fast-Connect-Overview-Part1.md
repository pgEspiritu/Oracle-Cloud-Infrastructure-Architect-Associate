# Lesson: Oracle FastConnect

## ðŸ”¹ What is FastConnect?
- A **dedicated and private connection** between your **on-premises environment** and **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.  
- **Implications:**
  - âœ… Higher bandwidth options  
  - âœ… More reliable (private connection)  
  - âœ… Consistent network experience  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts of FastConnect

### 1. FastConnect
- Private, **physical connectivity** between OCI and your on-prem network.

### 2. FastConnect Location
- An **Oracle data center** where you can connect to OCI.

### 3. Metro Area
- A **geographical area** with multiple FastConnect locations.  
  Example: Location 1 + Location 2 in the same metro area.

### 4 & 5. Oracle Partner vs Third-Party Provider
- **Oracle Partner**:  
  - Network service provider integrated with Oracle in a FastConnect location.
- **Third-Party Provider**:  
  - Not an Oracle partner, but still a network service provider.  
  - Requires **LOA (Letter of Authorization)** to establish connection.

### 6. Co-Location
- Your equipment (edge servers) is also **deployed in a FastConnect location**.  
- You have your own cage with servers in the same facility.

### 7. Cross-Connect
- The **physical cable connection** in FastConnect.  
- Represents the physical layer of connectivity.

### 8. Cross-Connect Group
- A **collection of cross-connects** used when you need **higher bandwidth**.

### 9. Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)
- Required for **private peering** (on-prem â†” VCN).  
- Not needed for **public peering** (on-prem â†” Public OCI services).

### 10. Virtual Circuit
- The **logical connection** in FastConnect.  
- Represents an **isolated network path**.  
- Two types:
  - **Public Virtual Circuit** â†’ On-prem â†” Public OCI Services  
  - **Private Virtual Circuit** â†’ On-prem â†” VCN  

### 11. BGP Session
- **Exchange of routing information** between two autonomous systems.  
- Used for dynamic routing over FastConnect.

### 12. BFD (Bi-directional Forwarding Detection)
- **Verifies connectivity** between devices.  
- Detects failures quickly between adjacent networks.  
- Does **not** exchange routing information.

### 13 & 14. Oracle Edge
- Located in the Oracle cage at a FastConnect location.  
- **Physical Device**: Terminates the **cross-connect** (physical connection).  
- **Logical Device**: Terminates the **virtual circuit** (logical connection).

### 15. LOA (Letter of Authorization)
- Needed when Oracle grants permission to establish a **physical connection**.  
- **Not applicable** for Oracle Partner model.  
- **Required** for:
  - Third-Party Provider connections  
  - Co-location model (submitted to data center technician)

## ðŸ”¹ Connectivity Models (Overview)
1. **Partner Model** â†’ No LOA required, partner already integrated.  
2. **Third-Party Provider Model** â†’ LOA required for third-party.  
3. **Co-Location Model** â†’ LOA required, given to data center technician.

## âœ… Summary
- **FastConnect** = Dedicated & private connection to OCI.  
- Combines **physical (cross-connect)** and **logical (virtual circuit)** components.  
- Improves **bandwidth, reliability, and consistency**.  
- Understanding **partners, providers, co-location, and LOA** is essential for choosing the right connectivity model.
