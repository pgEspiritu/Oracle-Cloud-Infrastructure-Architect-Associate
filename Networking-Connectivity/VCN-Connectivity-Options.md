# üåê OCI Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) Connectivity Options

## 1. Overview
A **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can connect to:
- **Another VCN in the same region** ‚Üí Local Peering
- **Another VCN in a different region** ‚Üí Remote Peering
- **On-premises network** (customer location)

---

## 2. VCN-to-VCN Connectivity

### 2.1 Local Peering (Same Region)
- **Definition:** Connection between two VCNs in the same OCI region.
- **Configuration Options:**
  1. **Local Peering Gateway (LPG)**
  2. **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) attachments** (both VCNs connect to the same DRG)
- **Routing:**  
  After configuring peering, add appropriate **route rules** to the VCN route tables.

---

### 2.2 Remote Peering (Different Regions)
- **Definition:** Connection between two VCNs in different OCI regions.
- **Configuration:** Use **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG)** for cross-region connectivity.
- **Routing:** Route rules must be configured to allow cross-region traffic.

---

## 3. VCN-to-On-Premises Connectivity

### 3.1 Public Internet
- **Description:**  
  Connectivity using **Internet Gateway** or **NAT Gateway**.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Unencrypted by default (application-level encryption optional)
  - Best for **SaaS applications** or **POC testing**
  - Traverses public internet

---

### 3.2 Site-to-Site VPN
- **Description:**  
  Encrypted IPsec VPN tunnel between on-premises and OCI.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Secure connectivity over internet
  - **No throughput guarantee** (depends on internet performance)
  - OCI-managed service (free)
  - Good for **POC or non-latency-sensitive workloads**

---

### 3.3 FastConnect
- **Description:**  
  Dedicated, private connection between on-premises and OCI.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Low latency** and **high bandwidth** (up to 100 Gbps)
  - **Secure & consistent performance**
  - No egress data transfer charges (only hourly port charges)
  - OCI-managed service
  - Ideal for **business-critical** or **latency-sensitive** applications

## 4. Comparison Table

| Option            | Security       | Latency      | Bandwidth   | Cost           | Best For |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Public Internet   | Optional (app-level) | High (internet-based) | Variable    | Low           | SaaS, POC |
| Site-to-Site VPN  | Encrypted      | Medium       | Variable    | Free service  | POC, general secure connectivity |
| FastConnect       | Secure, dedicated | Low          | Up to 100 Gbps | Port charges | Business-critical, latency-sensitive |

---

## 5. Key Notes
- **Local Peering** = Same region, via LPG or DRG.
- **Remote Peering** = Different regions, via DRG.
- Always **configure route rules** after peering.
- Public internet is **quickest to set up**, but not ideal for production secure workloads.
- FastConnect offers **best performance** but requires more setup.

---

‚úÖ **Conclusion:**  
OCI provides flexible VCN connectivity options‚Äîchoose based on **latency needs**, **security requirements**, and **cost considerations**.
