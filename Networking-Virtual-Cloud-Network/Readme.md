# Networking â€“ Virtual Cloud Network  

This section introduces the **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It covers the essential building blocks of networking, including CIDR blocks, subnets, route tables, gateways, and security configurations. Demos are included to reinforce concepts with hands-on practice.
