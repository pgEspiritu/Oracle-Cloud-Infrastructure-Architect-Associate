# Question 1

**You create a file system and then add a 2 GB file. You then take a snapshot of the file system.  
What would be the total `meteredBytes` shown by the File Storage service after the hourly update cycle is complete?**

- A) 2 GB  
- B) 2.5 GB  
- C) 3 GB  
- D) 4 GB  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**B) 2.5 GB**

---

## Explanation of Choices

- **A) 2 GB**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - This only accounts for the file data. Snapshots also consume additional storage.  

- **B) 2.5 GB** ‚úÖ  
  - ‚úî Correct.  
  - The **snapshot of the file system is incremental** and stores metadata plus any new data blocks.  
  - For a single 2 GB file, the snapshot adds roughly **0.5 GB** of overhead (metadata + snapshot tracking), resulting in **2.5 GB total meteredBytes**.  

- **C) 3 GB**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - Overestimates the snapshot overhead for a single small file.  

- **D) 4 GB**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - This would be if snapshots duplicated all data entirely, but OCI uses **space-efficient snapshots**.  

---

## üîë Key Takeaway
OCI File Storage **meteredBytes includes actual data + snapshot overhead**. Snapshots are incremental and **do not double the storage**, but they do add some metadata overhead.

# Question 2

**You are migrating several legacy virtualized applications to OCI. The current CentOS version does not match any Oracle-provided images. How would you migrate your existing virtual server images?**

- A) Export in VDI format ‚Üí Object Storage ‚Üí Import as custom image, **native mode**  
- B) Export in VMDK format ‚Üí Object Storage ‚Üí Import as custom image, **native mode**  
- C) Export in QED format ‚Üí Object Storage ‚Üí Import as custom image, **emulated mode**  
- D) Export in QCOW2 format ‚Üí Object Storage ‚Üí Import as custom image, **emulated mode**  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**B) Export your current image in the VMDK format and copy to an Object Storage bucket. Import it as a custom image. Select native mode to ensure the best possible performance.**

---

## Explanation of Choices

- **A) VDI format, native mode**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) is **not supported** for direct OCI custom image imports.  

- **B) VMDK format, native mode** ‚úÖ  
  - ‚úî Correct.  
  - OCI supports **VMDK (VMware disk format)** for importing custom images.  
  - Selecting **native mode** ensures the imported image runs efficiently with OCI hypervisor.  

- **C) QED format, emulated mode**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - QED is **not a standard disk format** for OCI imports. Emulated mode is only needed for older or incompatible drivers, which is unnecessary for standard Linux images.  

- **D) QCOW2 format, emulated mode**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - QCOW2 is primarily used in **KVM environments**; OCI prefers VMDK or raw formats for custom image imports.  
  - Emulated mode reduces performance and is unnecessary if drivers are compatible.  

---

## üîë Key Takeaway
For migrating **existing virtualized Linux servers** to OCI:  

1. Export in **VMDK format**.  
2. Upload to **Object Storage**.  
3. Import as a **custom image**.  
4. Use **native mode** for best performance.

- C) Create a custom image and use it as a template  
- D) Use Oracle-provided images and customize via a third-party tool  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**C) Create a custom image and use it as a template for the new instances**

---

## Explanation of Choices

- **A) Bring your own image**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - BYOI involves importing an external OS image. Since you already have a running instance, creating a **custom image from it is faster and simpler**.  

- **B) OCI Marketplace image**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - Marketplace images are pre-built vendor images. They **won‚Äôt include your specific installed software and configuration**, so additional setup would be required.  

- **C) Create a custom image** ‚úÖ  
  - ‚úî Correct.  
  - A **custom image** captures the current instance **with all installed software and configuration**.  
  - It can then be used as a template to launch **identical new instances** with minimal effort.  

- **D) Oracle-provided image + third-party tool**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - This would require **manual customization** for each new instance, which is **more work than using a custom image**.  

---

## üîë Key Takeaway
When you need **identical instances quickly**, use a **custom image of a configured running instance** as a template.

- B) The instance will get terminated  
- C) The instance is either reboot-migrated or rebuilt in place for you  
- D) You will receive another notification to reboot within the next 7 days  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**C) The instance is either reboot-migrated or rebuilt in place for you**

---

## Explanation of Choices

- **A) Another notification in 14 days**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - OCI does **not simply resend notifications**; the maintenance action will proceed automatically after the due date.  

- **B) Instance termination**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - OCI will **not terminate the instance**; it ensures maintenance by either **reboot-migrating or rebuilding in place**.  

- **C) Reboot-migrated or rebuilt in place** ‚úÖ  
  - ‚úî Correct.  
  - If the instance cannot be live-migrated, OCI **automatically takes care of it** by either:  
    - Reboot-migrating it to new hardware, or  
    - Rebuilding it in place while retaining the boot and block volumes.  

- **D) Another notification in 7 days**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - OCI maintenance notifications do **not follow a fixed 7-day reminder cycle**.  

---

## üîë Key Takeaway
For **instances that cannot live-migrate**, OCI ensures maintenance completion automatically by **reboot-migrating or rebuilding the instance** after the scheduled due date. No manual reboot is strictly required, but proactive action can avoid downtime.

# Question 6

**A financial firm wants high availability and fault tolerance for financial data stored in OCI Object Storage. Data should survive even if an entire region fails. What should the architect do?**

- A) Create a lifecycle policy to regularly send data from Standard to Archive storage  
- B) Create a replication policy to send data to a different bucket in another OCI region  
- C) Copy the Object Storage bucket to a block volume  
- D) Create a new Object Storage bucket in another region and configure a lifecycle policy to move data every 5 days  

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Answer:  
**B) Create a replication policy to send data to a different bucket in another OCI region**

---

## Explanation of Choices

- **A) Lifecycle policy from Standard ‚Üí Archive**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - Lifecycle policies only manage **storage tiers within the same region**.  
  - They do **not protect against regional outages**.  

- **B) Replication policy to another region** ‚úÖ  
  - ‚úî Correct.  
  - **Cross-region replication** copies objects automatically to a bucket in another OCI region.  
  - This ensures **high durability and availability**, even if the original region becomes unavailable.  

- **C) Copy bucket to block volume**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - Block volumes are **AD-specific** and not suitable for Object Storage replication or high availability across regions.  

- **D) New bucket + lifecycle every 5 days**  
  - ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  - Copying data manually every 5 days does **not provide real-time durability** and risks data loss between copies.  

---

## üîë Key Takeaway
To achieve **high availability and regional fault tolerance** in OCI Object Storage, use **cross-region replication** rather than lifecycle policies or manual copies.
